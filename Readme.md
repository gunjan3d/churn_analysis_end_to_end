### Machine Learning Prediction Web Application
# Scope
This project aims to create a web application that allows users to input various features related to customer data and receive a prediction on whether the customer will churn (leave the service) or not. The backend is implemented using FastAPI and leverages a pre-trained machine learning model (churn.h5). The frontend is developed using React and Tailwind CSS.

# Features
Frontend: A form with input fields for various customer-related features.
Backend: An API that processes the input data, performs predictions using a machine learning model, and returns the result.
Prediction: The model predicts whether a customer will churn (1) or not (0).
# Dependencies
# Backend
FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
Uvicorn: A lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools.
TensorFlow: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.
NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
# Frontend
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
# Requirements
Python 3.7+
Node.js 14+
